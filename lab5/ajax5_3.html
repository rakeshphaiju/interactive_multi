    <h1>JQuery</h1>
        <p>
            JQuery is the most popular JavaScript library which enables us to make client-side JavaScript really easy. JQuery makes creating smooth animation effects really easy, handling events such as user interaction and dealing with AJAX easy and efficient.<br><br>
            As a web developer, JQuery makes it faster to use animations as well as handling events efficient. This saves a lot of time beacuse we don't need to write all the JavaScript codes. JQuery does that for us. In our previous participants' list, we can use JQuery to add some animation effects and to make AJAX call to stored persons' list and load them. <br><br>
            CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a service by which contents such as data, file and documents are served to users with ease and high end performance. For example: CDN enabled contents such as JQuery are loaded from the nearest server to the user, so that the action is fast and easy.
